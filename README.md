# Explore the Loan Data from Prosper
## by Ajeethaa


## Dataset

> The loan data is from a peer-to-peer lending company called Prosper Marketplace which is based in San Francisco, USA. Not only can individual borrow money but also invest in personal loans. This project examines the data and connected variables about borrowers.


## Summary of Findings

> Thorough this project, I have investigated to find out how the unemployed borrowers fare, not only in securing a loan but in getting a fair deal in terms of loan terms and the interest rate. I have also looked into the number of overdue payments and compared these data with their monthly income and monthly loan payment. In conclusion, inspite the difference in the population size between the groups, one can observe similiarties between them as well.
